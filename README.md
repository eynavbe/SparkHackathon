# SparkHackathon


### The hackathon is a spark for generations
Raising awareness and providing solutions to challenges related to improving the lives of Holocaust survivors, education and commemoration.

### the problem
* Identification - the generation that lived through the Holocaust is disappearing, while the modern world is constantly changing. These facts create distance between the memory of the Holocaust and future generations.
* Preservation of memory - bringing to life the testimonies and the people behind the stories.


### the solution
* A dedicated platform for commemorating information, media and testimonies of Holocaust victims and survivors through the integration of advanced technologies such as Metaverse, AI and more whose purpose is to generate identification and affinity based on the personalization of the viewer

* Website - the user enters and enters basic characteristics (gender, age, profession) - the system presents at least one victim/survivor who resembles him, leading him through an interactive experience, during which he is offered to "adopt" the story and become an ambassador for that victim.
